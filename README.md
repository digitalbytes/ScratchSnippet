Scratch Snippet
===============

This is a simple Sublime Text 2 plugin that allows you to create a throw away scratch snippet.

 * **CRTL-OPTION-S** to create a new snippet called *scratch*
 * **CTRL-SHIFT-S** to insert that snippet

You may also use standard completion of *scratch* to insert the created snippet.

The scratch snippet persists through sublime text 2 restarts and is stored in `Packages/User/scratch.snippet`
